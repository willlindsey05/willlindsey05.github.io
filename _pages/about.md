I'm an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) with a passion for hands on learning. This blog is a collection of walkthroughs and technical notes from my journey through various Hack The Box (HTB) machines. Each post documents the techniques, tools, and thought processes I use across enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation.

Whether you're preparing for the OSCP, sharpening your penetration testing skills, or simply curious about how these machines are rooted, I hope you find something useful here.
